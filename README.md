## Model description
This model was mainly developed by Marloes Boeters (UU) as part of her Ph.D. thesis and Beatriz Gar-cia-Morante (IRTA), with the support of Sébastien Picault (INRAE). The aim of this work was to estimate multiple burdens of M. hyopneumoniae infection on a Dutch commercial fattening farm. Additionally, the model was used to evaluate a range of intervention strategies and their effects on these burdens. Specifically, the model provides insights into development of clinical signs and lung lesions, and quan-tifies the impact of infection and interventions on various outcomes, including pig health indicators, antibiotic use, production performance, economic results, labour requirements, and CO₂ emissions from feed use.

The model is stochastic, mechanistic, and individual-based, and accounts for multiple levels to repre-sent a realistic spread of pathogens (within-pen, between-pen and airborne transmissions). The indi-vidual pigs are organized into 12 pens of 12 pigs each, and remain in the same pen from arrival at an age of on average 10 weeks until slaughter. The model accounts for infection dynamics (including both acute and chronic phases), and the development of coughing or lung lesions in a subset of infected pigs. To aid the estimation of the labour and economic burden of the disease, the model includes production performance (i.e. weight gain and feed intake), which may be impacted by the disease. Additional economic values (e.g. average costs and prices) were based on 2024 Dutch market data. 

Additionally, the model estimates the effects of interventions, both more common interventions (i.e. vaccination and compartment-level antimicrobial treatment) and a set of alternative intervention strategies related to detection, treatment, and management practices.
